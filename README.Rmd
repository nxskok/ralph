# ralph

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `ralph` is to demonstrate the construction of a package by providing a function to compute a correlation and display the result as a dataframe.

## Installation

You can install the 
development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nxskok/ralph")
```

## Thanks 

to Shannon Pileggi (@pipinghotdata) for the worked example [here](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-10-25-your-first-r-package-in-1-hour/). This is a shameless rip-off of that.

## Example

This is a basic example:

```{r example}
library(ralph)
## basic example code
compute_corr(mtcars, mpg, wt)
```
